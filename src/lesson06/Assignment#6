A)
    Drug info)
    name <-> drug number
    dosage <-> method of admin
    description -> name


    Administration info)
    (dosage <-> units per day) -> name
    method of admin <-> (drug number -> name)

B)
    we have two different things here, drug information, and protocal/administration of the drug
    so we have two tables first:
    drug_info, administration

c)
    so we would have a drug info table:
    drug_number, name, description, dosage
    drug_number being the primary key of the table

    prescription table which looks like:
    prescription_id, drug_number (primary key for drug info table), method_of_admin, start_date, finish_date
    with prescription_id being the primary key of the table
