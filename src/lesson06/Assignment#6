A)
    units per day -> dosage


B)
    1NF, there is already unique rows currently, just need to identify a identifying key which we cant
    2NF, we need to separate redundant dependent data, so we create a separate table for drug info
    3NF we create a table connecting the isolated information with a new primary key prescription_id

c)
    so we would have a drug info table:
    drug_number, name, description, dosage
    drug_number being the primary key of the table

    prescription table which looks like:
    prescription_id, drug_number (primary key for drug info table), method_of_admin, units_per_day, start_date, finish_date
    with prescription_id being the primary key of the table
